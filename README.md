## Prerequisites
- Bash shell environment
- Permission to execute shell scripts

## Environment Setup

### Using the Setup Script
1. Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x create_environment.sh
    ```

2. Run the setup script:
    ```bash
    ./create_environment.sh
    ```

The script will:

## Notes
